## Rewrite (3.0)

Here we go! This is a rewritten version of Comp_V2 (with some exceptions).  
We are at b2, I don't Vex V5 Hardware to test with, as school is over.  
When high school starts for me, I *will* be in a robotics class, and then I can start testing.

2: Read advanced motor config and triport config. ✅
3: Scrolling on loghandler when messages are too big ✅
